                                Process Scheduling is the process of the process manager handling the removal of an
                                active process from the CPU and selecting another process based on a specific strategy.
                                Process Scheduling is an integral part of Multi-programming applications. Such operating
                                systems allow more than one process to be loaded into usable memory at a time and the
                                loaded shared CPU process uses repetition time.

                            <br>
                            <b>Why do we need to schedule processes?</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Scheduling is important in many different computer environments. One of the most
                                    important areas is scheduling which programs will work on the CPU. This task is
                                    handled by the Operating System (OS) of the computer and there are many different
                                    ways in which we can choose to configure programs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Process Scheduling allows the OS to allocate CPU time for each process. Another
                                    important reason to use a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy at
                                    all times. This allows you to get less response time for programs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Considering that there may be hundreds of programs that need to work, the OS must
                                    launch the program, stop it, switch to another program, etc. The way the OS
                                    configures the system to run another in the CPU is called “context switching”. If
                                    the OS keeps context-switching programs in and out of the provided CPUs, it can give
                                    the user a tricky idea that he or she can run any programs he or she wants to run,
                                    all at once.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    That’s where scheduling comes in! First, you determine the metrics, saying something
                                    like “the amount of time until the end”. We will define this metric as “the time
                                    interval between which a function enters the system until it is completed”. Second,
                                    you decide on a metrics that reduces metrics. We want our tasks to end as soon as
                                    possible.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            CPU scheduling <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">is the process of deciding which
                                process will own the CPU to use while another process is suspended. The main function of
                                the CPU scheduling is to ensure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS has at least
                                selected one of the processes available in the ready-to-use line.
                                In Multiprogramming,if the long-term scheduler selects multiple I / O binding processes
                                then most of the time, the CPU remains an idle. The function of an effective program is
                                to improve resource utilization.
                                If most operating systems change their status from performance to waiting then there may
                                always be a chance of failure in the system. So in order to minimize this excess, the OS
                                needs to schedule tasks in order to make full use of the CPU and avoid the possibility
                                of deadlock.
